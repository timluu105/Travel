# Write an application for travel plans

## Checklist:

- [ ] User must be able to create an account and log in. (If a mobile application, this means that more users can use the app from the same phone).
- [ ] When logged in, a user can see, edit and delete trips he entered.
- [ ] Implement at least three roles with different permission levels: a regular user would only be able to CRUD on their owned records, a user manager would be able to CRUD users, and an admin would be able to CRUD all records and users.
- [ ] When a trip is entered, it has Destination, StartDate, EndDate, Comment.
- [ ] When displayed, each entry also has day count to trip start (only for future trips).
- [ ] User can filter trips.
- [ ] Print travel plan for next month.
- [ ] REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication (If a mobile application and you don’t know how to create your own backend you can use Firebase.com or similar services to create the API).
- [ ] In any case, you should be able to explain how a REST API works and demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly. Please be prepared to use REST clients like Postman, cURL, etc. for this purpose.
- [ ] If it’s a web application, it must be a single-page application. All actions need to be done client side using AJAX, refreshing the page is not acceptable. (If a mobile application, disregard this).
- [ ] Functional UI/UX design is needed. You are not required to create a unique design, however, do follow best practices to make the project as functional as possible.
- [ ] Write unit and e2e tests.
